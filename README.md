# Cyber Security Course Project

## Project Description
We are trying to implement a welldetailed phishing attack on a website. We will be using a phishing tool to clone a website and then host it on a server. We will then send a phishing email to the target and get the credentials of the target. We will then analyze the data and see how we can prevent such attacks.
